# SupplyChainModel_EatonPratibha

Problem Statement: Lead Time, Safety Stock, Minimum Order Quantities and ABC classification are key part parameters which form the basis of Materials Planning. Create a model which
Takes into account the various factors in Supply Planning which contribute to these parameters
Identifies the right method to re-calculate these parameters assuming there is current value of these parameters already defined but needs evaluation and optimization based on parameters identified in point(1) above
Simulates the impact of the re-calculated parameters on Inventory levels
The model can be built in excel or other analysis and visualization tools as per convenience, but should clearly outline the input, calculation process, simulation capabilities and stage wise output

Product chosen: Power Inverters
