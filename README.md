# SupplyChainModel_EatonPratibha

Problem Statement: Lead Time, Safety Stock, Minimum Order Quantities and ABC classification are key part parameters which form the basis of Materials Planning. Create a model which
<ol>
<li>Takes into account the various factors in Supply Planning which contribute to these parameters</li>
<li>Identifies the right method to re-calculate these parameters assuming there is current value of these parameters already defined but needs evaluation and optimization based on parameters identified in point(1) above</li>
<li>Simulates the impact of the re-calculated parameters on Inventory levels</li></ol>
The model can be built in excel or other analysis and visualization tools as per convenience, but should clearly outline the input, calculation process, simulation capabilities and stage wise output
